 Markov chain based weather pattern probablity project
 
 An M/M/1 queue represents the queue length in a system having a single server, where arrivals are determined by a Poisson process. (Theory of Probability)
 
  The Poisson point process is used in queuing theory to model random random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store or phone calls at an exchange, distributed in time

Simulating an M/M/1 queue, assuming customers come according to a poisson process with rate 0.5 person per minute and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean 3 minutes. Estimate the mean waiting time for the system.
